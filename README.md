## Graham Ormiston

In the last 5 years I've been learning a huge amount running my own small creative consultancy, [Novo](http://wearenovo.com). My role was primarily the sole front-end developer, personally delivering over 70 sites to clients. I also learnt how to manage projects and freelancers, how to keep a business afloat and client facing skills.

I'm looking to become an employed front-end or full stack developer. Having just completed [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) (a 16 week intensive software development bootcamp) to further my skills, I feel ready to be incorporated into a professional environment where I can both contribute and ideally be supported in continuous learning.

## Skills


#### Front-end development

Being a front-end developer has been a major part of my working life since 2011. Roughly half of my work has been based around a *WordPress* or *Joomla* CMS with a template built from scratch in *HTML, CSS and JS*, with the rest being static sites built with some *PHP* to add functionality.

- personally built *over 70 production websites* over 5 years
- experience working with *Linux servers* for hosting (*command line* and *cPanel*)
- working with frameworks like *jQuery and SASS, vanilla JavaScript, PHP, MySQL*

#### Creative problem solving

Through my development work, I've come to realise that coding is effectively a digital form of product design - and *finding elegant solutions* to existing problems is the essence of being a good product designer. I'm a *quick debugger* utilising a variety of techniques to get to the bottom of an issue, with a sharp eye for small details.

#### Rapid learner

I have a passion for learning - I've taught myself much of my front-end knowledge, as well as several musical instruments, videography, a little (Brazilian) Portuguese... I'm self motivated and don't require coaxing to learn something well.

I get most excited when I'm thrown into a situation where I have to learn quickly. Above all, my time at Makers Academy taught me *how to learn any concept*, meaning I am better equipped to *pick up languages quickly* and explore new development topics.

#### Comfortable team leader

In the last 5 years I've had the opportunity to manage small teams in a variety of contexts, including freelancers on web projects and video shoots. I'm able to *motivate and encourage* team members to work towards a shared goal, and I like to use an encouraging and supportive style with struggling members to help them reach their potential and gain confidence.

Steve Coffey, *Hope and Homes for Children*

> Since working with Graham, I have never failed to be surprised by his creative mindset. He has a dedication to serving clientâ€™s interests to the best of his ability and is always striving towards exceeding their expectations. Time and time again Graham has taken a project on board and produced remarkable work that the client is then thoroughly impressed by.

> I knew exactly how I wanted my new site to look and work for the user, but expected I'd have to make a few compromises. In fact, Graham worked really hard on some heavy customisation to create all the visual and technical elements, exactly as I wanted. His communication was also thorough and concise, which was really useful as I'm based in Tokyo...

Duncan Shotton, *Duncan Shotton Design Studio*

> I worked with Graham to develop a promotional website service. Every website he designed looked fantastic, in keeping with the 'feel' of each product, and functioned to a very high standard, meeting W3C web standards.
