## Graham Ormiston

In the last 5 years I've been learning a huge amount running my own small creative consultancy, [Novo](http://wearenovo.com). My role was primarily as the sole front-end developer, personally delivering over 70 sites to clients.

I'm looking to become a full stack developer. Having just completed [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) (an intensive software development bootcamp) to further my skills, I feel ready to be incorporated into a professional environment where I can both contribute and ideally be supported in continuous learning.

## Skills

#### Front-end developer

Being a front-end developer has been a major part of my working life since 2011.

**Client website examples**
- Over 70 websites built, including:
senturionkey.com, motionnutrition.com, innovate-design.co.uk,

#### Server management and maintenance

Finding solutions to existing problems is the essence of being a product designer. I've come to realise that coding is effectively a form of digital product design, requiring design, structure and an understanding of the problem to build elegant solutions.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Project / Team Management

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

#### Self Starter, Self Trained, Self Motivated

I have a huge passion to learn, whether that's coding, business, music...

## Reviews of my work

> Graham has delivered three fantastic websites for us - the work was excellent, cost-effective and turned around on time within some tight timescales...

Steve Coffey, *Hope and Homes for Children*

> I knew exactly how I wanted my new site to look and work for the user, but expected I'd have to make a few compromises. In fact, Graham worked really hard on some heavy customisation to create all the visual and technical elements, exactly as I wanted. His communication was also through and concise, which was really useful as I'm based in Tokyo...

Duncan Shotton, *Duncan Shotton Design Studio*

> Since working with Graham, I have never failed to be surprised by his creative mindset. He has a dedication to serving clientâ€™s interests to the best of his ability and is always striving towards exceeding their expectations. Time and time again Graham has taken a project on board and produced remarkable work that the client is then thoroughly impressed by.

Jay Short, *Inition*

> I worked with Graham to develop a promotional website service [at Innovate]. Every website he designed looked fantastic, in keeping with the 'feel' of each product, and functioned to a very high standard, meeting W3C web standards.

Amy Green, *Innovate Product Design*
